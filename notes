----this seems not to be important

Register CKGR_MOR page 267
	PMC base address 0xFFFFFC00
	CKGR_MOR 0x0020
	set MOSCEN to 1
	OSCBYPASS must be 0

	OSCOUNT has 8 bits and starts at exactly 8 in CKGR_MOR

	check PMC_SR the MOSCS bit to check whether it's stablized
	PMC_SR 0x0068
	MOSCS check for 1 at 0

24.5.2 Period Inerval Timer(PIT)
	System timer base address
		0xFFFF FD00
	set ST_PIMR - period interval mode register
	0x0004
	set PITS bit in ST_IER
		ST_IER 0x0014
	1<<0

	enable interrupt by writing PITS bit in ST_IER
 	set frequency PIV (16 bits) in ST_PIMR

 	255 cycles is roughly 60ms(62 per manual)
 	max PIV can be programmed to 65536 as per manual into PIV
 	as 65536 = 2^16
 	so 65536 = 256*32
 	therefore max timer is 62ms*32=1984
 	therefore max frequency is roughly 2 seconds
