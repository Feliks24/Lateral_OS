LIB
there's a memcopy implementation in lib/mem.c
copies from one adress to other of some size n
HEADERS
in header files include/system.h defines some PSR control bits
as well as the psr modes/modus bits??
DRIVER
mc_remap
in memory driver there is mc_get_abort_adress which writes from MC to some AASR
which is the 3rd component in the MC 
16.3.4

START
init_other_stacks();
init_exception();
Software interrupt
	with asm("swi #0")
Data Abort
	*(int *)0xa00000000=0; //Chapter 8 in AT91RM9200
Undefined Instruction
	asm(".word 0x07F000F0") //A3.16.5 im ARM architecture RM
SYSTEM
ASSEMBLER

cpu_asm.S
	implements _set_stack, get banked sp lr, get_cpsr/spsr, calc_store_pc_offset
exception_asm.S
	implements the trampoline _exception_vectors_begin
system/memlayout.h defines stack bottom as 0x24000000 adn stack size as 1024*64

info is just printing the registers
